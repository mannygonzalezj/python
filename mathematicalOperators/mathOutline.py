#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

a = "what" + "the"
print(a)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

b = 4 + 4
print(b)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

c = 3 - 1
print(c)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

d = 3.28 - 4.91
print(d)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

e = 5 * 5
print(e)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

f = "ever" * 4
print (f)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

g = 9/3
print (g)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

h = 9.826/3.82
print (h)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

i = 8 % 3
print (i)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

j = 6 // 5
print (j)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

k = 5**7
print (k)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

k 5*6
print (k)
